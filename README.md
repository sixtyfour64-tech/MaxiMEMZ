# For skids
I know you are gonna skid from me and claim everything you did is "YOURUUUSSRRS!!111!1!"
<br>so to prevent that, I added the MIT license, meaning you must add a copyright notice (Original source by 64, Malware by 64, etc.) before using any of its source code.
<br>People caught not doing so will be asked to take their malware down, whether they want to or not.
<br>In addition to the former, you must also licence your project with the same licence.
